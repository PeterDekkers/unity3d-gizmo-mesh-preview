# Gizmo mesh previews for prefabs in Unity3D

Just a quick script to preview prefabs using gizmo meshes in Unity3D. This is mainly useful if you're using pooled prefabs and want to see a visual representation of them in your scene.

This script can be adapted and added to your pool spawning script to render gizmo meshes for all the meshes in a prefab.
